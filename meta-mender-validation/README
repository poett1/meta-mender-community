II. Misc
========

This layer contains various means of validating a Mender integration on
a given device.

- bootloader-validation: this script implements an automated run of the
  integration checklist as documented at https://docs.mender.io/client-installation/integration-checklist.
  It installs a systemd service to run the script at startup, which requires
  a number of reboots to check the various bootloader integration facets.
  Make sure the following preconditions are met:
  1. `INIT_MANAGER = "systemd"`
  2. `MENDER_FEATURES_ENABLE:append = "mender-prepopulate-inactive-partition"`
  After completion, the systemd service is automatically disabled and the
  result can be found in the `/data/validation.log` file.
