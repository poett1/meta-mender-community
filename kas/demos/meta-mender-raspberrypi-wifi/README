I. Adding the meta-mender-raspberrypi-wifi layer to your build
=================================================

Run 'bitbake-layers add-layer meta-mender-raspberrypi-wifi'

II. Purpose
===========

The layer contains an example setup for a Yocto build which enables
wifi on a Raspberry Pi 4 including SSID/password configuration.

The example image "core-image-raspberrypi-wifi" does so based on a
`core-image-base` image.

III. Legal notice
=================

The layer requires accepting the "synaptics-killswitch" license as 
documented at https://meta-raspberrypi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ipcompliance.html#linux-firmware-rpidistro

The kas file [`raspberrypi4-64-state-scripts.yml`](../raspberrypi4-64-wifi.yml) therefore adds the directive
```
    LICENSE_FLAGS_ACCEPTED = "synaptics-killswitch"
```
in order to be functional. Please note that this is for the sake of
testing, and by default not suitable for redistribution.

IV. Included functionality
==========================

The `wificonfig` package is the core trigger for the example functionality,
so adding it to other images will enable most of the functionality.

By setting the DEMO_WIFI_SSID and DEMO_WIFI_PASSKEY variables in your configuration,
you can inject SSID and password for the desired network into the image.
